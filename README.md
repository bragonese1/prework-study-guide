# Prework Study Guide

## Description

    The motivation behind this project is to provide a study guide for new coding bootcamp students. This project will hopefully provide guidance to new students on what topic they should study. It takes out the guess work and provides a useful place to store study guide facts. I learned throughout this project how each of these programs interact with one another and how they build on eachother.
